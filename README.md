# Rust Console APIs

[![ci](https://github.com/heaths/console-rs/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?event=push)](https://github.com/heaths/console-rs/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

These Rust Console APIs provide a level of abstraction over virtual terminals, implement testable 'std::io::Write' and will support color schemes.

_This name not final, but aligns with my [github.com/heaths/go-console](https://github.com/heaths/go-console) Go APIs._
